"""The semantic index goes stale silently, and that is a retrieval failure.

The index is built on demand and never invalidates itself. The README told users
to "build the index once". So it drifts behind the vault, and nothing anywhere
said so - not search, not vault_health.

Why that is worse than it sounds: an unindexed note is still reachable by
literal word match, so on English queries the lexical arm covers the gap and the
drift is invisible. On a query written in another language the lexical arm
contributes nothing - measured on the RU/ES eval set, every single hit came from
the semantic arm and the gold note's lexical rank was absent or in the hundreds.
For those queries an unindexed note is not merely ranked low, it cannot be
retrieved at all. A vault measured during this work had 29% of its notes
uncovered with no warning.

These tests pin the two places that now report it, and the streaming reader that
makes reporting it affordable on a 66MB index.
