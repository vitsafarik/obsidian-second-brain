"""Cross-platform conformance for the adapter build pipeline.

The existing smoke tests build four platforms individually and assert that a few
paths exist. That left three ways for a build to ship broken while CI stayed
green, all three of which had actually happened:

  1. `bash scripts/build.sh` with no --platform (the all-platforms loop) was
     never exercised, and three adapters were never built at all. A sabotaged
     adapter could emit an empty tree and the suite still passed 198/198.
  2. The SKILL_ROOT placeholder is a Claude Code affordance. Five of seven builds
     shipped it unresolved, so every Python-backed command tried to cd into a
     directory literally named SKILL_ROOT.
  3. `rewrite_platform_paths()` only matched `.claude/`, which appears in no
     command or reference file. Every bare `references/...` path shipped
     unrewritten, so the AI-first write spec was unreachable on four platforms.

These tests are parametrized over the adapters directory, so a new adapter is
covered the day it lands rather than the day someone remembers to add a test.
