"""The star prompt has to be impossible to see twice, and easy to never see.

A prompt asking for a favour is the one piece of output where being wrong is
costly in both directions. Fire it twice and the tool is spam. Fire it in CI and
it is a bug. Gate it so hard it never fires and the work was theatre - which is
what the first version of this did, by checking `stdout.isatty()` in a project
where an agent runs the scripts and stdout is a pipe essentially always.

So both directions are tested: every suppression path, and the fact that it does
still fire when it should.
