"""The portable spec must not drift from the specification it summarises.

`AI-FIRST.md` is a 50-line drop-in version of `references/ai-first-rules.md`,
meant to be pasted into someone else's CLAUDE.md or AGENTS.md with an
attribution line. Two documents stating the same rules is exactly the setup that
produced B21 and S18 in this repo: copies do not stay equal on their own.

The risk here is asymmetric. If the long spec gains a rule and the short one
does not, every downstream copy is quietly incomplete, and unlike the adapters
there is no build step that would notice. So these tests fail when the rule
count diverges, when a rule's subject disappears from the short form, or when
the pieces that make it adoptable (attribution line, version, canonical URL) go
missing.
