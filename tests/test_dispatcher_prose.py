"""The AI-first rule summary must have exactly one definition.

Four adapters each emit a "How to operate" block whose third step summarises the
vault-write spec: the `## For future agent` preamble, the required frontmatter
keys, wikilinks, recency markers, sources, confidence. Until now each adapter
carried its own hand-typed copy, differing only in the path it cites and in how
the prose happened to be line-wrapped.

CLAUDE.md says this rule is non-negotiable and must move in lockstep across
platforms. Four copies make that a promise nobody can keep: B21 was a path in
one copy that did not exist in that platform's own build, and it survived
because the other three were right and nobody diffed them.

These tests do not check the wording. They check that the wording has one home,
and that every platform's dispatcher actually ships it pointing at a file that
exists in that platform's own tree.
