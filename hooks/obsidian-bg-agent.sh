#!/usr/bin/env bash
# obsidian-bg-agent.sh - PostCompact vault propagation hook
#
# Fires after Claude compacts the conversation context. Reads the session
# summary from stdin (JSON), then runs a headless Claude agent to propagate
# everything worth preserving to the vault.
#
# TRUST CAVEAT: this agent writes to the vault UNATTENDED using
# --dangerously-skip-permissions. For that reason it is OPT-IN and ships INERT.
# It requires BOTH of the following before it does anything:
#   - OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH set (where to write), AND
#   - OBSIDIAN_BG_AGENT_ENABLED=1 (a second, deliberate enable flag)
# setup.sh sets the first but never the second, so the agent stays inert after a
# normal install. See hooks/postcompact.hook.example.json for the opt-in steps.
#
# Setup:
#   1. Set OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH in the env section of ~/.claude/settings.json
#   2. Set OBSIDIAN_BG_AGENT_ENABLED=1 in the same env section to enable
#   3. Register this script as a PostCompact hook (see postcompact.hook.example.json)
#   4. Make executable: chmod +x hooks/obsidian-bg-agent.sh
# To disable again: clear OBSIDIAN_BG_AGENT_ENABLED (the gate below makes that enough).
#
# Logs: /tmp/obsidian-bg-agent.log

VAULT="${OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH:-}"
[[ -z "$VAULT" ]] && exit 0

# Opt-in gate: no-op unless the user deliberately enabled the agent. This is the
# second of the two flags; without it the hook does nothing even when registered.
[[ "${OBSIDIAN_BG_AGENT_ENABLED:-0}" != "1" ]] && exit 0

# PostCompact stdin includes `transcript_path`; the compaction summary itself
# is written into the transcript JSONL as entries with `isCompactSummary: true`.
# We read the most recent one here.

You are an autonomous Obsidian vault agent. The Claude session was just compacted.
Propagate everything worth preserving from the summary to the vault. Run silently.

VAULT: $VAULT
TODAY: $TODAY

SESSION SUMMARY:
HEADER

printf '%s\n\n' "$SUMMARY" >> "$PROMPT_FILE"

cat >> "$PROMPT_FILE" << 'INSTRUCTIONS'
INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Read _CLAUDE.md at the vault root first - follow its rules exactly. Where silent, use defaults.
   This vault is CZECH. Use ONLY the Czech folder names below. NEVER create English
   folders (no People/, Projects/, Daily/, Ideas/, Boards/, Dev Logs/). Folder map:
   People -> lide/, Projects -> projekty/, Daily -> denik/ (YYYY-MM-DD.md),
   Ideas -> napady/, Boards -> nastenky/ (Obsidian Kanban), Dev Logs -> log/prace/,
   operational log -> log/YYYY-MM-DD.md (append-only). Write note bodies in Czech,
   including the "## Pro budouci Claude" preamble (not "## For future Claude").
2. Identify all vault-worthy items in the summary:
   - Decisions made or confirmed
   - Tasks created, assigned, or completed
   - People mentioned (new interactions, context added)
   - Projects worked on or updated
   - Dev work done (code written, bugs fixed, features shipped)
   - Ideas, learnings, or insights
   - Shoutouts or mentions worth logging
3. Before creating any note, search for an existing one. Never duplicate.
4. Update or create notes as appropriate:
   - People: update lide/jmeno.md interaction log; create a stub if missing
   - Projects: update status, recent activity, key decisions sections in projekty/
   - Dev work: create or update log/prace/YYYY-MM-DD-projekt.md; link from project note
   - Tasks: add to the right column of the existing board nastenky/ukoly.md (use TODAY date)
   - Ideas: save to napady/
   - Decisions: append to the relevant projekty/ note's decisions section
5. Update today's daily note (denik/[TODAY].md using the TODAY value above):
   - Create it from the daily template in sablony/ if it does not exist
   - Link everything you touched - people, projects, dev logs, decisions
6. Propagate everywhere:
   - Nothing is saved in isolation
   - Every write ripples to the daily note, boards, and linked notes per the write rules

CONSTRAINTS:
- Use filesystem tools only (Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep) - MCP is not available in this subprocess.
- Run completely silently. No output to the user. No questions.
- If the summary contains nothing vault-worthy, exit without making any changes.
- Match the vault's existing writing style, frontmatter schemas, and naming conventions exactly.
- Do not archive, delete, or merge anything - only add or update.
