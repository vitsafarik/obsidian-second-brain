/**
 * Tests for the AI-First checks.
 *
 * These run on the compiled bundle rather than the TypeScript source, using
 * node:test with no framework, so they need no extra dependency and prove the
 * thing that actually ships is the thing that was tested.
 *
 * A linter's failure mode is not crashing, it is being wrong in a way that
 * teaches people to ignore it. False positives are tested as carefully as true
 * ones: a note that flags a URL inside a code fence gets switched off within a
 * day, and then the whole plugin is worth nothing.
