"""Vault operations for the Obsidian Second Brain MCP server.

Pure stdlib, no MCP dependency, so the logic is unit-testable on its own. The

Every write follows the AI-first rule (references/ai-first-rules.md): frontmatter
with type/date/tags/ai-first, a `## For future Claude` preamble, and a
`source: mcp` marker so notes added through the connector are distinguishable.
