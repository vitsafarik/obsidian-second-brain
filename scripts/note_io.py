"""note_io.py - byte-exact read/write for scripts that rewrite vault notes in place.

Scripts that only READ a note may decode forgivingly (errors="replace"); a lossy
copy that dies in memory hurts nobody. A script that reads, edits, and WRITES BACK
must never do that: every undecodable byte would be saved to disk as a permanent
U+FFFD, and the text-mode round-trip would silently rewrite CRLF line endings.

Rule enforced here: strict UTF-8 in, byte-exact UTF-8 out, and a file we cannot
decode losslessly is never rewritten at all.

Writes are atomic. A note is rewritten by writing a sibling temp file and renaming
it over the target, so an interrupted write (Ctrl-C, a crash, a disk that fills
mid-write) can never leave a real note truncated or half-written. The original
survives untouched until one final same-filesystem rename swaps the new bytes in.
