"""Migrate a monolithic vault log.md into per-day files under Logs/.

Splits the original log.md by `## [YYYY-MM-DD]` headers (brackets optional,
trailing text on the header line is ignored) into individual files named
`Logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md`, each with proper AI-first frontmatter. Replaces the
root log.md with a thin pointer file that documents the new structure and
ships the entry template.

Idempotent: skips dates whose target file already exists. Prints a summary.

Safety: log.md is only replaced with the pointer when EVERY dated section was
carried over. If any date was skipped because its target already existed, that
section still lives only in log.md, so overwriting it would destroy the sole
copy. In that case the original is left untouched and the run exits non-zero.

Usage:
    python scripts/migrate_log.py --vault /path/to/vault [--dry-run]

## Where to look

- **Today's writes** - `Logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- **History** - `ls Logs/` then read the day(s) you need
- **Cross-day queries** - search `Logs/` directly, do not scan this file

## Per-day file template

When creating a new `Logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md`:

```markdown
---
type: log
date: YYYY-MM-DD
ai-first: true
