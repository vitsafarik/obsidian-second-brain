"""Topic tokenization for vault scans - delegates to the search tokenizer.

One tokenizer, one fix (#159, #188, #192, #212): `vault_scan` in notebooklm.py
and research_deep.py each kept a private whitespace-split + `len(w) > 2` copy
that returned nothing for CJK topics, and the copies survived three fixes to
the canonical tokenizer because every fix landed in one path and not the
others. This module is the single sanctioned import path to
`vault_ops._query_terms` for the research toolkit; do not re-implement
tokenization here or in a caller.
