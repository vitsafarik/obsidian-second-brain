"""Bounded page reader via the Tavily Extract API. Optional deep-research upgrade.

/research-deep's synthesis normally sees only citation snippets. When
TAVILY_API_KEY is set, the top sources are fetched as page text and injected
into the synthesis prompt, so the synthesizer reads what the pages actually
say instead of guessing from snippets. Pattern from fork-insights round 2
(the web-reader fork).

Bounded, not complete: each page is cut at MAX_EXTRACT_CHARS and the cut is
marked inline. Do not describe the output as "full text" - a long page arrives
as its opening section, and a reader told otherwise will treat what is missing
as absent from the source rather than absent from the excerpt (#194).

Contract: never raises. Any failure returns what was extracted so far (or {});
deep research must proceed snippet-only when extraction is unavailable. Paid:
Tavily Extract bills credits per URL batch - hence the hard URL cap.
