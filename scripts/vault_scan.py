"""Canonical vault-scanning policy: which directories every tool skips.

Six tools each carried their own hardcoded exclude set. Only five entries were
common to all six, and the differences were a mix of two very different things:

  Real intent, worth keeping
    export_okf skips `excalidraw`  - drawings are not exportable prose
    vault_stats skips `raw`/`references` - not user notes for counting purposes

  Drift, which is the bug
    `_trash` appeared in 4 of 6, `node_modules` in 4 of 6
    agent config dirs (.agents, .codex, .gemini, .opencode) in only 2 of 6
    `Templates` in one tool and `templates` in three others, so the same folder
    was skipped or scanned depending on which tool ran and how the user had
    capitalised it

So this is a shared BASE plus explicit per-tool additions, not one merged set.
Merging outright would have silently widened three tools and thrown away the
intent behind the other two.

Matching is case-insensitive, which is what makes the Templates/templates split
stop mattering. `vault_health.VaultExcludes` remains the user-facing extension
point for `.vault-config.json`; this module is the floor beneath it.
