# adapters/hermes/adapter.sh - Nous Research Hermes Agent platform adapter
# =============================================================================
# Hermes Agent ships a native Skills System (agentskills.io-compatible): a skill
# is a directory `skills/<category>/<name>/` with a `SKILL.md` (YAML frontmatter
# + body). Hermes loads skills with progressive disclosure, the user installs a
# set by adding the repo as a "tap" (`hermes skills tap add <owner/repo>`) or
# copying into `~/.hermes/skills/`, and invokes them via `/skills` or implicit
# description match.
#
# We emit one native Hermes skill per command, grouped by category. This is the
# Hermes-runtime counterpart to the Codex native-skills adapter (Phase 2 of the
# Hermes work, Issue #79). The MCP connector (integrations/obsidian-mcp-server)
# is the separate bounded-data path; this adapter is the skill/playbook path.
#
# SKILL.md frontmatter (per Hermes creating-skills spec):
#   required: name, description, version, author, license
#   optional: metadata.hermes.tags (+ more we do not need here)

# Where INSTALL.md below tells the user to copy the tree, and therefore the only
# path a `uv run --directory` can name. It has to be a concrete path rather than

# working directory", and a cron blueprint is armed with `--workdir <vault>`, so
# the CWD at run time is the vault, never the skill root. `--directory "."` from
# there resolves to the vault (no pyproject.toml, no scripts/) and every
# Python-backed skill dies on `No such file or directory` (#191).

Phase 1 - Close the day:
- Read today's daily note. Append a ## End of Day section with a 3-5 bullet summary.
- Move any completed kanban tasks to Done.

Phase 2 - Reconcile:
- First resolve the entities, concepts, and decisions folders per \`references/folder-map.md\` (at the install root,
  \`$HERMES_INSTALL_ROOT/references/folder-map.md\`): the vault's \`_CLAUDE.md\` Folder Map wins, else wiki-style
  \`wiki/entities/\` + \`wiki/concepts/\` + \`wiki/decisions/\`, else Obsidian-style \`People/\` + \`Knowledge/\` (and \`Ideas/\`) + \`Knowledge/\`.
  A resolved folder that does not exist is a skip, not an error. Never scan a hardcoded \`wiki/\` path on a vault with no \`wiki/\` folder -
  unattended, that is three tool failures a night with nothing to show for them.
- Scan the entities folder for outdated roles, companies, or descriptions that conflict with newer daily notes.
- Scan the concepts folder for claims contradicted by recently ingested sources.
- Flag EVERY contradiction as a \`type: conflict\` note with \`status: open\` in the decisions folder. Do NOT rewrite any existing page -
  resolving a contradiction rewrites the outdated note, which is destructive and irreversible while the user sleeps. Leave that to an
  interactive obsidian-reconcile run.

Phase 3 - Synthesize:
- Scan sources ingested today and yesterday. Find concepts that appear in 2+ unrelated sources.
- If patterns found: create \`Synthesis - Title.md\` in the concepts folder resolved in Phase 2, with evidence and interpretation.

Phase 4 - Heal:
- Find notes created today with no incoming links. Add links from relevant existing pages.
- Close entity timeline entries missing an \"until\" date that should be closed.
- Rebuild \`index.md\` to reflect today's changes.

Phase 5 - Log:
- Append an operation-log entry: if \`Logs/\` exists write \`**HH:MM** - nightly | End of day + X flagged, Y synthesized, Z orphans linked\`
  to \`Logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md\`; otherwise append \`## [YYYY-MM-DD] nightly | ...\` to \`log.md\`.

# Hermes: scheduled maintenance and the PostCompact analog

The Claude Code build maintains the vault two ways: opt-in scheduled agents
(`/schedule`) and an opt-in PostCompact hook (`hooks/obsidian-bg-agent.sh`) that
propagates conversation context into the vault after the context is compacted.
This documents the Hermes equivalents.

## Scheduled maintenance (cron) - shipped

The four scheduled agents are emitted as native Hermes blueprint skills under
`optional-skills/`:

| Skill | Schedule | Does |
|---|---|---|
| `obsidian-morning` | `0 8 * * *` | Create today's daily note, surface due/overdue + stale projects |
| `obsidian-nightly` | `0 22 * * *` | Sleeptime consolidation: close day, reconcile, synthesize, heal, log |
| `obsidian-weekly` | `0 18 * * 5` | Generate the weekly review note |
| `obsidian-health-check` | `0 21 * * 0` | Vault health report (report only) |

They live in `optional-skills/` (not `skills/`) on purpose: the scheduled
agents are opt-in by design, so INSTALL.md's bulk `skills/` copy never ships
them implicitly. Installing a skill does not schedule anything - a Hermes
blueprint never arms silently. Copy them into `~/.hermes/skills/` like any
other skill (see INSTALL.md), then arm each schedule explicitly:

```bash
hermes cron create "0 22 * * *" "Run the obsidian-nightly scheduled vault maintenance. Follow the skill procedure exactly; do not ask questions; save and stop." --skill obsidian-nightly --name obsidian-nightly --workdir /path/to/vault
```

(A registry `hermes skills install` instead registers the blueprint as a
suggested cron job you accept from `/suggestions`.) Verify with
`hermes cron list`; run outputs land in `~/.hermes/cron/output/<job_id>/`.
None of them delete or archive - they only add, update, link.

## PostCompact analog (lifecycle hook) - shipped

The Claude PostCompact hook fires on context compaction to propagate the session
into the vault. Hermes's analog is the `on_session_end` event hook (declared
under the `hooks:` block of `~/.hermes/config.yaml`). This build ships it:

- **`hooks/obsidian-hermes-session-end.sh`** - an `on_session_end` hook that, on
  a completed (non-interrupted) session, runs the `obsidian-nightly`
  consolidation pass and prints `{}` (the observer-hook contract). It mirrors the
  Claude bg-agent's trust model exactly: OPT-IN, ships INERT, no-ops unless BOTH
  `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH` and `OBSIDIAN_HERMES_HOOK_ENABLED=1` are set; add/update
  /link only, never delete or archive.
- **`hooks/hermes-hooks.config.example.yaml`** - the paste-in
  `hooks:` block for `~/.hermes/config.yaml` registering the hook.

Install:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.hermes/agent-hooks
cp hooks/obsidian-hermes-session-end.sh ~/.hermes/agent-hooks/
chmod +x ~/.hermes/agent-hooks/obsidian-hermes-session-end.sh
# merge hooks/hermes-hooks.config.example.yaml into your ~/.hermes/config.yaml,
# then: export OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH=... OBSIDIAN_HERMES_HOOK_ENABLED=1
```

The consolidation runs headlessly via `hermes -z` (one-shot mode: prompt passed
as the argument, only the final response printed). Override the command with
`OBSIDIAN_HERMES_CONSOLIDATE_CMD` if your build differs; the script appends the
prompt as the command's final argument. The `obsidian-nightly` cron job covers
the same maintenance on a daily cadence regardless.

# Install on Hermes Agent

The obsidian-second-brain commands are emitted here as native Hermes skills
under `skills/<category>/<name>/SKILL.md` (agentskills.io-compatible).

## Option A - install from this built tree

```bash
# From the repo root, after `bash scripts/build.sh --platform hermes`:
mkdir -p ~/.hermes/skills/obsidian-second-brain
cp -R dist/hermes/skills/. ~/.hermes/skills/obsidian-second-brain/
# Shared specs + Python helpers the skills reference:
cp -R dist/hermes/references ~/.hermes/skills/obsidian-second-brain/references
cp -R dist/hermes/scripts    ~/.hermes/skills/obsidian-second-brain/scripts
```

## Option B - add as a tap (when published to a skills repo)

```bash
hermes skills tap add <owner>/<repo>
```

Then in Hermes:

- Browse with `hermes skills browse` / the `/skills` command, or just describe
  the task and let Hermes select a skill from its description.
- Skills run in your Hermes session. The AI-first vault rule lives in
  `references/ai-first-rules.md` - it is non-negotiable for every note a skill
  writes (`## For future agent` preamble, rich frontmatter, `[[wikilinks]]`,
  recency markers, sources verbatim, confidence levels). That path is relative
  to the install root, which is load-bearing: start Hermes elsewhere and it does
  not resolve. A skill that cannot read it must search upward for it, and say so
  before writing if it still cannot - the requirements in parentheses are the
  floor either way.
- Python helpers under `scripts/` run via
  `uv run --directory ~/.hermes/skills/obsidian-second-brain -m scripts.research.<name>`.
  The install root ships a `pyproject.toml`, so modules and dependencies both
  resolve there. Name it explicitly rather than relying on the working
  directory: Hermes is pointed at your *vault* as the working directory (and a
  cron job is armed with `--workdir <vault>`), so a bare `uv run -m scripts.X`
  looks for `scripts/` inside the vault and fails with `No module named
  'scripts'`.

## Scheduled agents (opt-in)

The four scheduled maintenance agents are emitted as native Hermes blueprint
skills under `optional-skills/` (morning / nightly / weekly / health-check).
They are NOT auto-armed - a Hermes blueprint never schedules anything silently.
Install them like any other skill, then arm each schedule explicitly:

```bash
# skills land in ~/.hermes/skills/ (Hermes discovers <category>/<name>/SKILL.md)
cp -R dist/hermes/optional-skills/. ~/.hermes/skills/obsidian-second-brain/
# arm the 10pm consolidation pass (repeat per agent - schedules in HOOKS.md)
hermes cron create "0 22 * * *" "Run the obsidian-nightly scheduled vault maintenance. Follow the skill procedure exactly; do not ask questions; save and stop." --skill obsidian-nightly --name obsidian-nightly --workdir /path/to/vault
```

Verify with `hermes cron list`. (When installed from a registry or URL via
`hermes skills install`, the blueprint is instead registered as a suggested
cron job you accept from `/suggestions` - a local built tree has no
installable identifier, so the cp + `hermes cron create` route above is the
default.)

See `HOOKS.md` for the full schedule table and the PostCompact-analog story.

Point Hermes at your vault as the working directory, or pair these skills with
the MCP connector (`integrations/obsidian-mcp-server/`) for bounded vault data
access.
