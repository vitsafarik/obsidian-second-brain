# adapters/agent-skills/adapter.sh - unified Agent Skills adapter
# =============================================================================
# One spec-compliant Agent Skills tree that every harness on the open
# `.agents/skills/` standard reads: Google Antigravity, OpenAI Codex CLI, and
# OpenCode. The three converged on the same path and the same progressive-
# disclosure contract (name + description always visible, body lazy-loaded), so
# a single build serves all of them instead of a near-duplicate adapter each.
#
# Emits, at the dist root:
#   skills/<name>/SKILL.md        - one skill per command (43; calendar is
#                                   Claude-only). Frontmatter is spec-minimal
#                                   (name, description, metadata.category) so
#                                   OpenCode's strict validator accepts it.
#   skills/obsidian-core/         - the shared engine skill: references/,
#                                   scripts/, and pyproject.toml. The command
#                                   skills' `uv run --directory SKILL_ROOT ...`
#                                   invocations are rewritten to point here.
#   INSTALL.md                    - skills.sh story + manual `cp -R` fallback.
#   global-rule-snippet.md        - optional always-on vault-routing rule.
#
# Design notes that matter:
#   - NO SKILL.md at the tree root: a shallow SKILL.md shadows every nested
#     skill in skills.sh discovery. The tree root carries docs only.
#   - Each skill body opens with a vault-root resolution preamble
#     ($OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH else the working directory) so the skills are
#     self-sufficient - no session-start hook required.
#   - references/ai-first-rules.md is embedded in every command skill so the
#     non-negotiable write spec survives even a cherry-picked install.
#   - The trigger policy (proactive vs explicit) is encoded in each description,
#     the only signal these harnesses use for implicit selection. Source
#     `trigger-mode: proactive` opts a command in; default is explicit.

## Setup (read first)

**Vault root.** Resolve it before reading or writing: use the \`\$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH\`
environment variable if it is set, otherwise use your current working directory.
Read \`_CLAUDE.md\` at the vault root first if it exists - it holds the user's vault
conventions (folder map, daily-note format, naming).

**Shared engine.** Script and reference paths below point at \`${ASK_CORE_PATH}\` -
the \`${ASK_CORE}\` skill installed alongside this one. Run script commands from your
workspace root so that relative path resolves; if you installed skills globally, use
the absolute path to the installed \`${ASK_CORE}\` directory instead.

## What this is

The shared support tree the other obsidian-second-brain skills depend on. It is
not a task skill - do not run it on its own.

- \`references/\` - shared specs. \`references/ai-first-rules.md\` is the canonical,
  non-negotiable vault-write spec; \`vault-schema.md\`, \`folder-map.md\`, and
  \`freshness-policy.md\` back the other skills. These paths are relative to the
  install root, which is load-bearing: if one does not resolve from your working
  directory, search upward for it, and say so before writing if you still cannot
  read it. Every command skill also embeds the AI-first spec inline, so the rule
  survives an unreachable path - but an unreachable path must never pass in
  silence.
- \`scripts/\` - Python helpers for the research toolkit and vault health. The
  command skills invoke them as
  \`uv run --directory ${ASK_CORE_PATH} -m scripts.research.<name> ...\`
  (or \`uv run --directory ${ASK_CORE_PATH} scripts/<name>.py ...\`), run from
  your workspace root.
- \`pyproject.toml\` - makes this directory a self-contained uv project, so both
  modules and dependencies resolve without a separate install step.

If you installed the skills globally rather than into a workspace, replace
\`${ASK_CORE_PATH}\` in those commands with the absolute path to this directory.

# Install as Agent Skills (Antigravity / Codex CLI / OpenCode)

This build is one spec-compliant Agent Skills tree. Every harness that reads the
open \`.agents/skills/\` standard - Google **Antigravity**, OpenAI **Codex CLI**,
**OpenCode**, and **GitHub Copilot CLI** among them - discovers these skills
automatically: each skill's name and description stay visible, and the full body
loads only when the skill is selected (progressive disclosure).

The tree contains \`skills/<name>/SKILL.md\` (${ASK_CMD_COUNT} command skills) plus the shared
\`skills/${ASK_CORE}/\` engine skill (references, scripts, pyproject). There is
deliberately **no SKILL.md at the tree root** - a root SKILL.md shadows the
nested skills during discovery.

## Where you start the harness is load-bearing

Start your harness **from the vault root**, or have the vault under git. This is
a requirement, not a convenience:

- Codex CLI walks up to the **git root** looking for \`.agents/skills\`. A
  git-backed vault therefore works from any subfolder.
- A plain Obsidian vault is not a git repo. In that case, opening the harness in
  any subfolder registers **zero** skills - no warning, no error, the skill list
  is simply empty.
- The \`.agents/skills/${ASK_CORE}/references/\` paths the skills cite are
  relative to this root too. Start elsewhere and the AI-first spec is a dead
  path, which is why every skill now says so out loud instead of silently
  skipping the rule.

If you keep your vault outside git and want to work from subfolders, run
\`git init\` in the vault root once. Reported by @Palo-Alto-AI-Research-Lab on
codex-cli 0.144.4 (issue #171).

## Option A - skills.sh (recommended)

[\`skills\`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) (\`npx skills\`) is a
GitHub-as-registry installer that writes one shared \`.agents/skills/\` tree all
three harnesses read. Run from your vault root:

\`\`\`bash
# preview what would install (should list $((ASK_CMD_COUNT + 1)): ${ASK_CMD_COUNT} commands + ${ASK_CORE})
npx skills add ./dist/agent-skills --list

# project-scope install for one or more harnesses (one physical tree serves all)
npx skills add ./dist/agent-skills -a antigravity -a codex -a opencode

# global scope instead of project scope
npx skills add ./dist/agent-skills -g -a antigravity -a codex -a opencode

# refresh after a rebuild
npx skills update
\`\`\`

Install the full set. The research and health skills call into
\`${ASK_CORE}\`, so cherry-picking individual skills breaks those; the full-set
install is the supported path.

## Option B - manual copy (no skills.sh)

\`\`\`bash
# From the repo root, after: bash scripts/build.sh --platform agent-skills
mkdir -p /path/to/your/vault/.agents/skills
cp -R dist/agent-skills/skills/. /path/to/your/vault/.agents/skills/
\`\`\`

## Per-harness notes

- **Antigravity** - discovers workspace skills at \`.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md\`
  and also surfaces each as a slash command (\`/skills\`). In \`--print\` (headless)
  mode the workspace must be registered explicitly with \`--add-dir <workspace>\`;
  running from inside the directory is not enough for headless skill discovery.
  Interactive sessions that open the workspace normally are unaffected. Global
  rules live in \`~/.gemini/GEMINI.md\` - see \`global-rule-snippet.md\`.
- **Codex CLI** - native Agent Skills at the same path. Invoke with \`\$<name>\`,
  via \`/skills\`, or let Codex match implicitly on the description.
- **OpenCode** - reads \`.agents/skills/\` (project) and \`~/.agents/skills/\`
  (global). Its validator is strict: only \`name\`, \`description\`, \`license\`,
  \`compatibility\`, and a string-map \`metadata\` are accepted, and \`name\` must
  match the directory - this build already conforms.
- **GitHub Copilot CLI** - loads project skills from \`.agents/skills/\` (and
  \`.github/skills/\`, \`.claude/skills/\`) and personal skills from
  \`~/.agents/skills/\` or \`~/.copilot/skills/\` (as of 2026-07,
  docs.github.com). The same tree works unchanged; the skills.sh agent target
  is \`github-copilot\`.
- **Anything else on the Agent Skills standard** - any harness that reads
  \`.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md\` picks this build up with zero changes.

## What is NOT covered

Agent Skills cover the commands only. The MCP vault server, Claude Code hooks,
and the scheduled maintenance agents remain Claude Code / Hermes extras. The
skills are made self-sufficient (vault-root resolution + the embedded write
spec) to compensate. For the optional always-on vault-routing rule, see
\`global-rule-snippet.md\`.

# Optional: always-on vault-routing rule

Agent Skills are selected per request. If you want your agent to always treat the
current workspace as an obsidian-second-brain vault - reading \`_CLAUDE.md\` up
front and honoring the AI-first write spec on every note - add the snippet below
to your harness's global rules file:

- **Antigravity**: \`~/.gemini/GEMINI.md\`
- **Codex CLI**: \`~/.codex/AGENTS.md\`
- **OpenCode**: \`~/.agents/AGENTS.md\` (or the project \`AGENTS.md\`)

## Obsidian second brain

This workspace may be an Obsidian vault managed by the obsidian-second-brain
Agent Skills. When it is:

1. Resolve the vault root: \`\$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH\` if set, else the workspace root.
2. Read \`_CLAUDE.md\` at the vault root first, if present, for vault conventions.
3. Prefer the installed \`.agents/skills/\` skills for vault actions (save, capture,
   log, decide, research, health, ...).
