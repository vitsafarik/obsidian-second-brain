# adapters/grok-bot/adapter.sh - Grok Bot / Sand platform adapter
# =============================================================================
# Grok Bot (aka Sand) reads the obsidian-second-brain MCP server for vault I/O
# and runs SKILL.md workflow files for playbooks. This adapter compiles the
# platform-neutral commands/ into Grok-runnable SKILL.md files.
#
# Emits, at the dist root:
#   skills/<name>/SKILL.md        - one skill per command (45; calendar is
#                                   excluded). Frontmatter is name + description
#                                   (when to use). Body tells the agent to use
#                                   MCP obsidian_* tools for all vault I/O.
#   skills/obsidian-core/         - the shared engine skill carrying references/,
#                                   scripts/, and pyproject.toml for Python-backed
#                                   commands.
#   INSTALL.md                    - how workflows and MCP work on Grok Bot / Sand.
#
# Design notes:
#   - Each skill body opens with MCP vault I/O instructions telling the agent to
#     use obsidian_* tools rather than filesystem operations.
#   - references/ai-first-rules.md is embedded in every command skill so the
#     non-negotiable write spec survives even a cherry-picked install.
#   - The trigger policy (proactive vs explicit) is encoded in each description.
#   - Grok Bot has no hook runtime, so no SessionStart or PostToolUse hooks.
#   - Python-backed research commands still need the scripts/ directory accessible;
#     the preamble tells the agent how to resolve that path.

## Setup (read first)

**MCP vault I/O.** All vault operations go through the `user-obsidian-second-brain`
MCP server. Use these MCP tools for vault reads, writes, and queries:

- `obsidian_search(query, limit)` - search the vault (lexical + semantic)
- `obsidian_read_note(path)` - read a note by vault-relative path
- `obsidian_save_note(title, content, note_type, tags)` - create a new note
- `obsidian_update_note(path, append, heading, set_fields)` - update an existing note
- `obsidian_replace_note_section(path, heading, new_content)` - replace a section
- `obsidian_move_note(path, new_path)` - move or rename a note
- `obsidian_capture(idea_text)` - quick-capture an idea (minimal schema)
- `obsidian_validate_note(path)` - validate against the AI-first spec
- `obsidian_backlinks(target)` - find notes linking to a target
- `obsidian_vault_health()` - run a full vault health check

**After writing any note, always call `obsidian_validate_note` with the path** to
ensure it meets the AI-first spec. The validator will report any issues.

**Vault root.** The MCP server resolves it from `$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH` or the
configured vault path. You do not need to resolve it yourself - the MCP tools
handle vault-relative paths.

**Python-backed commands.** A few research commands shell out to Python helpers.
The scripts live in the `obsidian-core` skill alongside this one. When a command
body below references a Python script, run it via the MCP server's environment or
locate the `scripts/` directory from the distributed skill tree.

description: "Shared engine for the obsidian-second-brain skills - the AI-first write spec (references/), the Python research toolkit (scripts/), and its uv project (pyproject.toml). Support files only; the other skills reference it. Do not invoke directly."
---

## What this is

The shared support tree the other obsidian-second-brain skills depend on. It is
not a task skill - do not run it on its own.

- `references/` - shared specs. `references/ai-first-rules.md` is the canonical,
  non-negotiable vault-write spec; `vault-schema.md`, `folder-map.md`, and
  `freshness-policy.md` back the other skills. These paths are relative to the
  install root, which is load-bearing: if one does not resolve from your working
  directory, search upward for it, and say so before writing if you still cannot
  read it. Every command skill also embeds the AI-first spec inline, so the rule
  survives an unreachable path - but an unreachable path must never pass in
  silence.
- `scripts/` - Python helpers for the research toolkit (research, research-deep,
  x-read, x-pulse, youtube, podcast, notebooklm, obsidian-architect). The command
  skills invoke them as `uv run -m scripts.research.<name> ...` or
  `uv run scripts/<name>.py ...`.
- `pyproject.toml` - makes this directory a self-contained uv project, so both
  modules and dependencies resolve without a separate install step.

When a command needs these, locate the obsidian-core skill directory in your
skill tree and reference it there.

# Install on Grok Bot / Sand

This build compiles the obsidian-second-brain commands into workflow SKILL.md
files that Grok Bot and Sand agents run. The \`user-obsidian-second-brain\` MCP
server (already connected in Grok Bot) provides the vault I/O layer; the compiled
skills are the playbooks.

The tree contains \`skills/<name>/SKILL.md\` (${GROK_CMD_COUNT} command skills) plus the shared
\`skills/${GROK_CORE}/\` engine skill (references, scripts, pyproject for Python-backed
research commands).

## How it works

- **Workflows are invoked with \`/\` or \`@\`.** Each SKILL.md is a self-contained
  playbook: name, description (when to use it), and operating instructions. Grok Bot
  and Sand load these as workflows you invoke by name.
- **MCP is the I/O layer.** Every vault read, write, search, or validation goes
  through the \`user-obsidian-second-brain\` MCP server's \`obsidian_*\` tools
  (\`obsidian_search\`, \`obsidian_read_note\`, \`obsidian_save_note\`,
  \`obsidian_update_note\`, \`obsidian_validate_note\`, etc.). The skills tell the
  agent which tool to call and how to structure the data.
- **No filesystem operations.** Unlike Claude Code or Codex (which use Read/Write
  tools on markdown files directly), Grok Bot skills exclusively use MCP tools.
  The agent never touches \`.md\` files - all vault I/O is mediated by the MCP server.

## Prerequisites

1. **MCP server connected.** Grok Bot already has the \`user-obsidian-second-brain\`
   MCP server available. Verify it by asking: "Do you have access to obsidian_search
   and obsidian_save_note?" The agent should confirm these MCP tools are present.

2. **Vault path configured.** The MCP server needs to know your vault location.
   The \`user-obsidian-second-brain\` MCP is pre-configured in Grok Bot. If you're
   using a different vault, ensure \`OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH\` points to your vault root
   (configured in the MCP server settings, not in Grok Bot itself).

## Installation

Grok Bot and Sand workflows are loaded from wherever you store your SKILL.md files.
The exact mechanism depends on your Grok Bot / Sand setup. Common patterns:

**Option A: Load skills into your workspace**

Place the skills where your Grok Bot session can access them:

\`\`\`bash
# From the repo root, after: bash scripts/build.sh --platform grok-bot
cp -R dist/grok-bot/skills /path/to/your/grok-workspace/
\`\`\`

**Option B: Reference skills directly**

If your Grok Bot setup supports skill directories, point it at the built tree:

\`\`\`bash
# After building
ls dist/grok-bot/skills/
# obsidian-save/, obsidian-find/, obsidian-daily/, ...
\`\`\`

Consult your Grok Bot / Sand documentation for the canonical skill loading path.

## Usage

Once loaded, invoke skills by name:

- "Save this conversation to my vault" → triggers \`obsidian-save\`
- "Find notes about the new project" → triggers \`obsidian-find\`
- "What's on my daily note today?" → triggers \`obsidian-daily\`
- Or explicitly: \`@obsidian-save\` or \`/obsidian-save\`

The agent will use the MCP \`obsidian_*\` tools under the hood, format the notes
according to the AI-first spec (embedded in every skill), and validate the output
automatically via \`obsidian_validate_note\`.

## What is NOT covered

- **Hooks** - Grok Bot has no hook runtime. There are no SessionStart or PostToolUse
  hooks. The skills are self-contained and do not rely on hooks.
- **Scheduled agents** - The morning/nightly/weekly/health routines are not included
  in this build. They remain a Claude Code / Hermes extra.
- **Calendar command** - \`/obsidian-calendar\` requires the Google Calendar MCP and
  is excluded from this build. It ships on Claude Code only.
- **Direct file access** - This build does not emit \`.agents/skills/\` or
  \`~/.agents/skills/\` paths (those are Codex / agent-skills conventions). Grok Bot
  workflows are standalone SKILL.md files, not Agent Skills.

## Verification

After installation:

1. Ask the agent: "Do you have the obsidian-save skill?"
2. Try a simple command: "Search my vault for project notes"
3. Save something: "Save this conversation with AI-first formatting"

The agent should confirm it has the skills and use the MCP tools to execute them.

## Troubleshooting

- **"I don't have access to obsidian_search"** → The MCP server is not connected.
  Verify \`user-obsidian-second-brain\` MCP is enabled in your Grok Bot settings.
- **"I can't find the skill"** → The SKILL.md files are not in a location Grok Bot
  is scanning. Check your skill loading path.
- **"The note wasn't saved"** → Check \`OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH\` in the MCP server
  configuration. The MCP server needs to know where your vault is.
