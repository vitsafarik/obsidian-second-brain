Use the obsidian-second-brain skill. Execute `/obsidian-capture $ARGUMENTS`:

The optional argument is the idea text. If not provided, pull the most recent idea or thought from the conversation.

1. Read `_CLAUDE.md` first if it exists in the vault root
2. Take the argument as the idea, or pull from recent conversation context
3. Resolve the idea folder per `references/folder-map.md` (read the vault's `_CLAUDE.md` Folder Map first; wiki-style ideas live in `wiki/concepts/`, Obsidian-style in `Ideas/`). Search it for a related existing note - if found, append to it
4. If new: create `<idea-folder>/Title.md` with the capture schema (`type: idea`, `date`, `tags: [idea]`, `ai-first: true`, `status: captured`, one-line body) - the documented capture exception in `references/ai-first-rules.md`: enrichment happens at graduation
5. Write the idea with any supporting context from the conversation
6. Add a brief mention in today's daily note under an Ideas or Captures section

**AI-first rule:** Every note created or updated by this command MUST follow `references/ai-first-rules.md` - `## For future agent` preamble, rich frontmatter (`type`, `date`, `tags`, `ai-first: true`, plus type-specific fields), recency markers per external claim, mandatory `[[wikilinks]]` for every person/project/concept referenced, sources preserved verbatim with URLs inline, and confidence levels where applicable. If that path does not resolve from your working directory, search upward for it; if you still cannot read it, say so before writing rather than producing a note that silently skips the rule. The vault is for future agent retrieval - not human reading. (The capture exception applies: minimal schema at capture, full enrichment at graduation.)

**Anti-fabrication:** Search exhaustively before claiming any note, person, or file is absent - false absence is the most common failure mode - and never invent facts, entities, or dates (mark unknowns as `TBD`). See the anti-fabrication and search-completeness hard rules in `references/ai-first-rules.md`.
